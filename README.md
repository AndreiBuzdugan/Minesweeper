Together with a colleague, we developed a Minesweeper game in Java, where the player, after entering their name, can select the size and difficulty of the board at the beginning of the game. We implemented a grid of fields with bombs randomly placed. The player can mark bomb-free fields, and if they uncover a field with a bomb, the game ends, and their locations are displayed. There is a time limit for completing bomb-free fields. At the end of the game, the results are recorded, including the player's name and their performance.
